## Disclaimer

Welcome to The Cookie Press Pro! We're thrilled you're here and excited to help you create perfect cookies, every time! Before you dive into the wonderful world of cookie making, please take a moment to read this disclaimer.

**Accuracy and Information:**

At The Cookie Press Pro, we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information on baking supplies, cookie presses, recipes, and baking techniques. Our content is based on our research, experience, and passion for baking. However, baking, like any craft, involves variables. Results can vary depending on factors such as ingredient quality, oven calibration, altitude, and even humidity.

Therefore, while we are confident in the information we provide, we cannot guarantee specific results. Always exercise your best judgment and baking intuition! We encourage you to experiment and adapt recipes to your own preferences and equipment.

**Product Recommendations and Reviews:**

We may occasionally recommend or review specific baking supplies, including cookie presses. These recommendations are based on our own testing, research, and user feedback. We always aim to provide honest and unbiased opinions. However, your experience with a particular product may differ.

We may participate in affiliate marketing programs, which means we may earn a commission when you purchase products through links on our site. This helps us maintain The Cookie Press Pro and continue providing valuable content. Please be assured that our editorial content is not influenced by these affiliate relationships. We only recommend products that we genuinely believe are beneficial to our audience.

**Safety and Allergies:**

Baking involves working with heat, sharp objects, and potentially allergenic ingredients. Always follow safe baking practices, including using oven mitts, handling hot equipment carefully, and being aware of potential allergens.

We strongly advise you to carefully read all ingredient labels and be mindful of any allergies or dietary restrictions you or your recipients may have. The Cookie Press Pro is not responsible for any allergic reactions or adverse health effects resulting from the use of our recipes or recommended products.

**External Links:**

Our website may contain links to external websites that are not under our control. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these websites. We provide these links for your convenience and information, but the inclusion of a link does not imply endorsement.

**Liability:**

The Cookie Press Pro provides information for educational and informational purposes only. We are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from the use of our website or the information provided herein.

**Changes to this Disclaimer:**

We reserve the right to modify this disclaimer at any time without notice. Please check this page periodically for updates.
